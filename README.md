In the contemporary landscape, power systems are undergoing significant transformations driven by the imperative need for an energy transition towards a completely decarbonized energy system. This master thesis, in particular, focuses on how distribution network operators should plan this transformation considering they have to face both a massive integration of renewable energy sources (RES) and an increased electrification of mobility, heating and industrial processes, through the use of low-carbon technologies (LCTs). This is the so-called <i>distribution network development planning problem (DNDP)</i>.

This master thesis lays the foundation for a broader research project whose purpose is to develop a new framework to solve the DNDP problem based on a co-optimization approach. This approach distinguishes from previous works as it models the interactions between the distribution network operator and its users, whose standpoints were previoulsy neglected. We translated our co-optimization framework into a bilevel mathematical optimization program where the upper-level represents the DNO's optimization program, while the lower-level models the aggregation of the optimization programs of all its grid users.

In conclusion, this research not only provides a first bilevel formulation for the DNDP problem but also establishes a tool for exploring various setups of the bilevel problem. This tool facilitated the execution of a preliminary sensitivity analysis, the outcomes of which shed light on the equilibrium dynamics between the strategies of the distribution network operator and its users.
